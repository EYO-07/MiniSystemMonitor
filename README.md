# MiniSystemMonitor (Windows 10,+)

Hi, I am oZumbiAnalitico an amateur programmer. This program was made with Visual Studio Community and assisted by [Grok A.I.](https://x.com/i/grok/share/WdFH29Jam1pfj4pfv0b7z85n6 ) It uses third party resources which I can't store here, so you need to find by yourself.
1. OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll ; Download the [OpenHardwareMonitorLib](https://openhardwaremonitor.org) and put the OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll inside the executable folder.
2. yt-dlp ; Works with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), put the yt-dlp.exe in the same directory or use the context menu to find yt-dlp.
3. Windows Media Player ; Sometimes windows users unistall wmp T.T
4. You can find the binaries on x64/release folder, add OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll and optionally yt-dlp.exe in this folder.
